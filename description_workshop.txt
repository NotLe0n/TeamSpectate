[h2]How it works:[/h2]

If you click on a player button other than your own, you start spectating the other player.
To exit the spectating mode press the player button again or press your own player.

You can NOT spectate players that are dead, in a different team than you, or don't exist.
Everyone can spectate players that are in no team.

If you can't spectate a player, their player head button turns grey.

You can also cycle different players using a hotkey (you have to set it fist)

You are also able to spectate a boss by clicking its button in the same menu.

If you die you automatically spectate the closest player (can be turned off).
When you respawn you automatically stop spectating (can also be turned off).
